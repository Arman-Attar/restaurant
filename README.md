# Restaurant Homepage Project 🍽️

Welcome to my Restaurant Homepage Project! 🏠🍴

In this project, I practiced DOM manipulation by dynamically generating the entire content of a restaurant homepage using JavaScript. I used Webpack for bundling and configured everything to be modular and dynamic. The restaurant homepage includes tabs for the Home, Menu, and Contact sections, all of which are dynamically loaded using JavaScript.

🛠️ **Project Overview**

This project involves building a simple restaurant website where all content is dynamically rendered using JavaScript. I used Webpack for module bundling, and JavaScript to create and append elements to the DOM for each "tab" (Home, Menu, Contact). The page structure and content are created purely with JavaScript, and the styling is handled separately in a CSS file.

🎯 **Features**

🍽️ **Dynamic Homepage**: The homepage, including header, navigation, and content, is dynamically generated using JavaScript.

🔄 **Tabbed Navigation**: The website supports tabbed navigation to switch between the Home, Menu, and Contact sections.

🖥️ **Modular JavaScript**: Each page section (Home, Menu, Contact) is handled by its own JavaScript module, which generates the corresponding content and appends it to the DOM.

🚀 **Deployment**: The project is deployed to GitHub Pages, with additional steps to push the bundled `dist` folder and set up the GitHub Pages deployment from the `gh-pages` branch.
